## Hello, world

Hi, I'm [Hans Gerwitz](https://hans.gerwitz.com/) and you won't find much from me, here.

When I grew up and wrote software for a living, we used [CVS](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/cvs). When I started contributing to open source projects, they used [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/). By the time git came to dominate and we all accepted GitHub as infrastructure, I had long since ascended beyond actual work.

Still, I continue to code and you might find something interesting in my public repos. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
